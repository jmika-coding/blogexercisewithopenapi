Launch first:
  * `npm install`

All the code is in `/src`

There is three configurations files `tsconfig.json` to use node with typescript, a small `package.json` for execution and `.env` for server port and database configuration

To launch project:
  * `npm run build`
  * `npm run start`

As this is only the backend, to use it without frontend, you could use curl

Exemple (in JSON, for correct type validation POST and PUT):
  * `curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:3000/posts -H "Origin: http://localhost"`
  * `curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"post":"My First Post", "likes":10, "comment":"A comment"}' http://localhost:3000/posts -H "Origin: http://localhost"`
  * `curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/posts/3 -H "Origin: http://localhost"`
  * `curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT --data '{"post":"My Modified Post", "likes":20}' http://localhost:3000/posts/4 -H "Origin: http://localhost"`

The database configuration is used in `configKnex.ts`, we use mysql but can change.
The table name as well as the database for this project is "blog"
